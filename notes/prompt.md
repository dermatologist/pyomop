write code to load a single csv file to multiple tables in a database using sql alchemy and an external mapping file.
All rows in the csv have an patient_id column
The sample csv file is referenced.

##

Write a function fix_person_id that updates all tables to replace the person_id foreign key with the person_id instead of person_source_value that it currently uses.

##

In the person table, replace 0 and null values in year_of_birth, month_of_birth and day_of_birth with the values from birth_datetime.

##

Write a function vocabulary_lookup that populates columns ending with _concept_id with concept_id values from the vocabulary table mapped based on the corresponding _source_value columns in the OMOP CDM.

##

Based on the concept key in mapping.example.json, implement the concept table lookup function.
Update the target field based on the source field lookup.
If source is an array, perform the lookup for the first element only.

Summarized conversation history

Here’s a compact handoff of the CSV→OMOP loader work, focused on what changed most recently and what’s next.

objectives
Load one CSV into multiple OMOP tables via SQLAlchemy using an external mapping file.
Every row has patient_id.
Mapping file expresses FHIR → OMOP CDM routing/column mapping.
what’s implemented
Generic mapping-driven loader: CdmCsvLoader (async SQLAlchemy, automap, chunked inserts, basic type coercion, simple row filters).
Exposed in package: __init__.py.
Example assets:
mapping.example.json (cohort, note).
load_csv_mapping.py (minimal runner using CDM v5.4 models).
Fixes: indentation/typing issues in _apply_filters corrected; relaxed typing to avoid DataFrame/Series mismatch.
Assumptions:

Using existing async engine/session from engine_factory.py.
CDM v5.4 ORM models in cdm54_tables.py.
latest operations and tool results
Checked repo changes: added/updated patient3.csv (large, FHIR-like rows; includes patientId). This aligns with the example mapping/loader targets (e.g., cohort, note).
Prior diagnostics noted unresolved imports for pandas/sqlalchemy in the new loader; expected until dependencies are installed in the environment.
current state
Loader ready for trial via example script; constants, direct mappings, equals/not_empty filters supported.
Not yet wired into CLI; no unit/integration tests; docs not updated.
Environment-only warnings remain until pandas/sqlalchemy are installed.
requirements coverage
CSV→multiple OMOP tables using SQLAlchemy + external mapping: Done.
patient_id present in all rows: Assumed and used by mappings: Done.
FHIR→OMOP mapping file: Example schema and usage provided: Done.
next steps
Add CLI command (flags: --csv, --mapping, --version, --chunk-size).
Create minimal integration tests using patient3.csv + mapping to assert inserts into cohort and note.
Document mapping schema/usage in README.
Enhance mapping (transform hooks, FK/concept lookups).
